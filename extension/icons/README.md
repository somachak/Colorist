# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels) — Toolbar icon
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels) — Extension management page
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels) — Chrome Web Store

## Creating Icons

You can create these using:
1. Figma, Canva, or any design tool
2. Export as PNG with transparent background
3. Use a simple palette/color wheel design

## Temporary Solution

Until you create icons, you can:
1. Use a free icon from [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com) or [Lucide](https://lucide.dev)
2. Create a simple colored square
3. Use an emoji-based placeholder

## Suggested Design

A simple design could be:
- A color wheel or palette icon
- Gradient from purple (#667EEA) to pink (#764BA2)
- Clean, minimal style matching Chrome's design language

*Note: The extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default puzzle piece.*
